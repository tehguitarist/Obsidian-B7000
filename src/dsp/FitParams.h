// =============================================================================
// FitParams — every Phase-7 CAPTURE-FIT constant, in one place
// =============================================================================
// The circuit's schematic-verified R/C values are NOT here — those are fixed
// facts (circuit.md is their source of truth) and stay `static constexpr` in
// their stages. What lives here is the much smaller set of constants that the
// build deliberately left NOMINAL because they cannot be read off a schematic:
// device-spread amplitude params (J201 ~5:1 part spread), the CD4049's finite
// open-loop gain and R19-dropped rail, pot taper SHAPES, the tolerance-sensitive
// bridged-T, and the op-amp rail ceilings. Each was flagged in-code as a
// "Phase-7 capture carry-forward"; this struct is where they all converge.
//
// **Why runtime instead of constexpr.** Every field below started life as a
// `static constexpr` in its stage. Fitting them that way costs a full rebuild
// per candidate value, which is fine for a one-line sanity tweak and hopeless
// for an actual fit: kA0 x kSatLo x kSatHi alone is a 3-D search, and the doc's
// extraction plan (nonlinear-component-modeling.md §4) asks for several such
// fits cross-checked against multiple captures. Making them settable lets
// OfflineRender sweep hundreds of candidates per minute from Python.
//
// **The nominal defaults are unchanged.** Each stage keeps its original
// `static constexpr kXxx` as the documented NOMINAL, and the matching field
// here is initialised from it — so a default-constructed FitParams reproduces
// the pre-refactor build exactly, and the per-stage tests (which reference the
// `kXxx` constants as their oracle) keep testing the nominal path. Nothing is
// re-tuned by this struct existing; it only makes the tuning possible.
//
// **Scope boundary.** These are all CHAIN-domain (real volts, inside
// PedalChain). The two DAW-domain scalars — `kInputRef` (volts per full scale)
// and `kOutputMakeup` — are processor-domain and deliberately NOT here; they
// live in PluginProcessor and are set on OfflineRender's command line
// separately. Keeping the two domains apart is the calibration doc's §1 rule
// (kInputRef must cancel in the linear path); folding them into the chain would
// blur exactly the boundary that rule depends on.

{
    // ---- CD4049UBE clipper (Clipper.h) --------------------------------------
    // clipA0 is the PRIMARY fit param: it sets BOTH the closed-loop gain AND the
    // three GRUNT corner frequencies (the input-node impedance is R18/(1+A0)), so
    // it is constrained by two independent measurements at once — fit it against
    // the GRUNT voicing and the drive-sweep level together, not either alone.
    // clipSatLo/clipSatHi are the per-side VTC ceilings; their SUM is the
    // R19-dropped effective rail (nominal ~7 V, below the 8.6 V op-amp rail) and
    // their DIFFERENCE is the even-harmonic asymmetry. Fit to the drive-sweep
    // Farina THD(f) + low-frequency-tone H2/H3 balance.

    // ---- J201 JFET stage (JfetStage.h) --------------------------------------
    // The ~5:1 J201 part spread means nominal SPICE cannot match a specific unit;
    // all of these are capture-fit by definition (nonlinear doc §2/§4). Fit to
    // the drive-MIN OD captures, where the CD4049 downstream contributes least.
    //
    // ** RESTRUCTURED 2026-07-22.** `jfetG0` (a lumped voltage gain that absorbed
    // the gate divider, the active-load impedance AND the R7 treble-net loading)
    // and `jfetGmR6` are both GONE. The stage is now a transconductance whose
    // output impedance is stamped into TrebleAttack, so:
    //   * jfetGm  replaces jfetG0 — the actual device gm. It also SETS the
    //     degeneration factor via gm*R6 (R6 is a fixed 3k3), which is why the old
    //     separate jfetGmR6 was redundant and is removed rather than renamed.
    //   * jfetRo / jfetRq2 are the loading that used to be folded into jfetG0.
    //     Together with gm they decide how much of the C3 shelf survives into the
    //     treble net — the single biggest lever on the OD path's HF balance.
    // Removing (not renaming) the old fields is deliberate: a stale
    // `--fit jfetG0=...` now fails loudly in OfflineRender instead of silently
    // setting something with different physical meaning.
    double jfetGm = 0.69e-3;   // S   (gm*R6 = 2.277 at nominal)
    double jfetRo = 200.0e3;   // ohm  Q1 drain output resistance (1/gos)
    double jfetRq2 = 1.0e6;    // ohm  Q2 C4-bootstrapped active-load impedance
    // jfetSatPos/Neg feed JfetStage's SQUARE-LAW even-shaper (JfetStage.h, Phase-7
    // reshape 2026-07-22), NOT the old tanh sat levels: jfetSatPos = knee `s` (volts),
    // jfetSatNeg = even-harmonic strength `a` (SIGNED). Names kept to avoid a rename
    // churn across PedalChain/OfflineRender/fit_nonlinear.py; semantics documented here
    // and at JfetStage::waveshape(). A clean rename is deferred polish.
    // ** The SCALE of `s` changed with the 2026-07-22 restructure: the shaper now sees
    // the effective vgs (real gate volts, order |Vp|), not a post-gain voltage. Any
    // s/a fitted before that date is meaningless — refit. **
    // ** The even bump's SHAPE also changed when the ceiling landed (same date):
    // a*s^2*(1-sech(w/s)) -> (a*s^2/2)*tanh^2(w/s), so its tail matches the ceiling's
    // and monotonicity has an interior (JfetStage.h waveshape()). `a` keeps its meaning
    // (the square-law quadratic, a = 1/Vov); its asymptote halved, and the ceiling-off
    // product bound moved from |a|*s < 2 to |a|*s < 2.598 — a DIFFERENT extremum of a
    // DIFFERENT function, not a revert of the 2026-07-22 bug fix. With a finite ceiling
    // NEITHER closed form is sufficient: the constraint couples s, a and jfetCeilNeg, so
    // a fitter must scan the slope NUMERICALLY (fit_nonlinear.py does). **
    double jfetSatPos = 0.3;   // s: square-law knee (gate volts)
    double jfetSatNeg = 1.0;   // a: even strength (signed)
    // ---- Asymmetric drain-current CEILING (added 2026-07-22) ----------------
    // The step-2 re-fit REJECTED its own result and diagnosed why: the capture's
    // H2 grows +6 dB across the drive sweep and the unbounded model's grew
    // +21.9 dB, so the fitter pinned |a|*s to the 2.0 monotonicity gate trying to
    // manufacture a ceiling out of a shape that has none, and pushed clipA0 to its
    // floor to weaken everything downstream (phase7-calibration-handover.md,
    // "STEP 2 RE-FIT"). These two give the J201 its own explicit limit.
    // Units: gate-volt equivalent — multiply by jfetGm for AMPS. Deliberately NOT
    // in amps: the cutoff headroom is Idq/gm = Vov/2, a pinch-off-voltage property
    // that should NOT move when the fitter moves gm.
    //   jfetCeilNeg = the negative-swing (drain rising) side. Q1 CUTOFF puts a hard
    //     device floor there at Idq/gm = Vov/2, and the same Vov sets the even
    //     strength (a = 1/Vov), so IF cutoff is what binds, 2*jfetCeilNeg*jfetSatNeg
    //     = 1 — the nominal 0.5 is exactly that identity at the nominal a = 1.
    //     ** Treat that as a WEAK check, not a requirement. ** Q2's own compliance
    //     limits the same swing at ~3 V/(gm*Zload) = 0.15 V at LF at nominal gm,
    //     i.e. TIGHTER than cutoff, so the identity only holds in the low-gm regime
    //     where cutoff wins. A fit that misses it is not automatically suspect; a
    //     fit that hits it is corroborated. (It also assumes a = 1/Vov, which is
    //     only the small-signal reading of `a` — see JfetStage.h waveshape().)
    //   jfetCeilPos = LOAD-LINE side (drain swinging down), circuit-set and
    //     band-dependent (~0.2 V at LF, ~0.9 V at 2 kHz into the node-G load at
    //     NOMINAL gm, and ~7.7x looser again at the gm the drive-min shape fit
    //     prefers) — a single memoryless number lumps that on purpose. Nominal
    //     1.0 V. Which side BINDS depends on gm and so is still open: at nominal gm
    //     the estimate above makes jfetCeilPos (0.2 V at LF) the tighter of the two;
    //     only under the low-gm hypothesis does the cutoff side bind.
    // The asymmetry between them is a SECOND source of even harmonics alongside
    // jfetSatNeg, and reinforces it in the same direction; expect the fit to trade
    // the two off. Passing >= 1e6 disables a side exactly (pre-ceiling model).

    // tolerance-sensitive — so all four values are fit parameters rather than
    // fixed, to be reshaped to whatever the capture actually shows (including
