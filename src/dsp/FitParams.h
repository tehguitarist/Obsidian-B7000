// =============================================================================
// FitParams — every Phase-7 CAPTURE-FIT constant, in one place
// =============================================================================
// The circuit's schematic-verified R/C values are NOT here — those are fixed
// facts (circuit.md is their source of truth) and stay `static constexpr` in
// their stages. What lives here is the much smaller set of constants that the
// build deliberately left NOMINAL because they cannot be read off a schematic:
// device-spread amplitude params (J201 ~5:1 part spread), the CD4049's finite
// open-loop gain and R19-dropped rail, pot taper SHAPES, the tolerance-sensitive
// bridged-T, and the op-amp rail ceilings. Each was flagged in-code as a
// "Phase-7 capture carry-forward"; this struct is where they all converge.
//
// **Why runtime instead of constexpr.** Every field below started life as a
// `static constexpr` in its stage. Fitting them that way costs a full rebuild
// per candidate value, which is fine for a one-line sanity tweak and hopeless
// for an actual fit: kA0 x kSatLo x kSatHi alone is a 3-D search, and the doc's
// extraction plan (nonlinear-component-modeling.md §4) asks for several such
// fits cross-checked against multiple captures. Making them settable lets
// OfflineRender sweep hundreds of candidates per minute from Python.
//
// **The nominal defaults are unchanged.** Each stage keeps its original
// `static constexpr kXxx` as the documented NOMINAL, and the matching field
// here is initialised from it — so a default-constructed FitParams reproduces
// the pre-refactor build exactly, and the per-stage tests (which reference the
// `kXxx` constants as their oracle) keep testing the nominal path. Nothing is
// re-tuned by this struct existing; it only makes the tuning possible.
//
// **Scope boundary.** These are all CHAIN-domain (real volts, inside
// PedalChain). The two DAW-domain scalars — `kInputRef` (volts per full scale)
// and `kOutputMakeup` — are processor-domain and deliberately NOT here; they
// live in PluginProcessor and are set on OfflineRender's command line
// separately. Keeping the two domains apart is the calibration doc's §1 rule
// (kInputRef must cancel in the linear path); folding them into the chain would
// blur exactly the boundary that rule depends on.

    // ---- CD4049UBE clipper (Clipper.h) --------------------------------------
    // clipA0 is the PRIMARY fit param: it sets BOTH the closed-loop gain AND the
    // three GRUNT corner frequencies (the input-node impedance is R18/(1+A0)), so
    // it is constrained by two independent measurements at once — fit it against
    // the GRUNT voicing and the drive-sweep level together, not either alone.
    // clipSatLo/clipSatHi are the per-side VTC ceilings; their SUM is the
    // R19-dropped effective rail (nominal ~7 V, below the 8.6 V op-amp rail) and
    // their DIFFERENCE is the even-harmonic asymmetry. Fit to the drive-sweep
    // Farina THD(f) + low-frequency-tone H2/H3 balance.

    // ---- J201 JFET stage (JfetStage.h) --------------------------------------
    // The ~5:1 J201 part spread means nominal SPICE cannot match a specific unit;
    // all of these are capture-fit by definition (nonlinear doc §2/§4). Fit to
    // the drive-MIN OD captures, where the CD4049 downstream contributes least.
    //
    // ** RESTRUCTURED 2026-07-22.** `jfetG0` (a lumped voltage gain that absorbed
    // the gate divider, the active-load impedance AND the R7 treble-net loading)
    // and `jfetGmR6` are both GONE. The stage is now a transconductance whose
    // output impedance is stamped into TrebleAttack, so:
    //   * jfetGm  replaces jfetG0 — the actual device gm. It also SETS the
    //     degeneration factor via gm*R6 (R6 is a fixed 3k3), which is why the old
    //     separate jfetGmR6 was redundant and is removed rather than renamed.
    //   * jfetRo / jfetRq2 are the loading that used to be folded into jfetG0.
    //     Together with gm they decide how much of the C3 shelf survives into the
    //     treble net — the single biggest lever on the OD path's HF balance.
    // Removing (not renaming) the old fields is deliberate: a stale
    // `--fit jfetG0=...` now fails loudly in OfflineRender instead of silently
    // setting something with different physical meaning.

    // churn across PedalChain/OfflineRender/fit_nonlinear.py; semantics documented here
    // and at JfetStage::waveshape(). A clean rename is deferred polish.
    // ** The SCALE of `s` changed with the 2026-07-22 restructure: the shaper now sees
    // the effective vgs (real gate volts, order |Vp|), not a post-gain voltage. Any
    // s/a fitted before that date is meaningless — refit. Any fitter must also enforce
    // the PRODUCT constraint |a|*s < 2 (monotonicity); box bounds cannot express it. **

    // which is surprisingly deep for this pedal, and the depth is highly
    // tolerance-sensitive — so all four values are fit parameters rather than
    // fixed, to be reshaped to whatever the capture actually shows (including
    // "much shallower than ideal"). The NOTCH FREQUENCY is far more trustworthy
