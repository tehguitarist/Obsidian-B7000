# Obsidian-B7000 — Project Memory  (from the pedal-plugin template)

> Obsidian-B7000 is a circuit-level emulation of the **Darkglass B7K Ultra** bass overdrive/DI preamp,
> built as an AU/VST3 plugin using JUCE 8+ and chowdsp_wdf. The schematic we have ("Black Mirror VII"
> by PCB Guitar Mania, rev 1.1v) is the ORIGINAL B7K clone; the Ultra-only features (Master volume,
> 3-way Attack, switchable mid frequencies) are **engineered on top of it** — see circuit.md [ENG] tags.
> Author/Company: Leigh Pierce

This project was scaffolded from a reusable template. The generic, hard-won engineering lives in
the rules + docs below — read them before writing DSP or UI. Replace every `<...>` placeholder.

## Quick reference

```
Build:  cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build
AU:     cmake --build build --target <Pedal>_AU     (auto-installs; bump VERSION to force Logic rescan)
Format: clang-format -i src/**/*.{cpp,h}
```

## Schematics

Put the schematic images in `schematics/` and load them whenever verifying a circuit detail.
`.claude/rules/circuit.md` is the source of truth for values/topology — fill it in first.

**Use the `schematic-checker` agent any time a circuit value or topology is in doubt; use
`dsp-validator` after any DSP stage change.** Both read `.claude/rules/circuit.md`/`dsp.md` —
keep those current and the agents stay useful with no extra setup.

## Delegation & model tiering

Plan with a high-end model, delegate execution down to cheaper ones — reserve the expensive
reasoning for the step that's actually hard to get right. As of July 2026 that means:

- **Planning** (build-sequence ordering, schematic-topology judgement calls, deciding what a
  session should tackle next) — a top-tier model at high effort (e.g. **Fable 5**, high effort).
- **Important thinking work** (circuit/DSP correctness: the `schematic-checker` and
  `dsp-validator` agents, anything cross-checking values/topology/taper against `circuit.md` or
  `dsp.md`) — a strong reasoning model at high effort (e.g. **Opus 4.8**, high effort). Both
  agents' frontmatter (`.claude/agents/schematic-checker.md`, `.claude/agents/dsp-validator.md`)
  are pinned to this tier — don't downgrade them to save cost, they're exactly the "important"
  category this policy protects.
- **Routine work** (mechanical edits, boilerplate scaffolding, formatting, running builds/tests)
  — a fast mid-tier model at medium effort (e.g. **Sonnet 5**, medium effort).

Re-evaluate the concrete model names as new ones ship; the tiering principle (plan high, validate
high, execute routine work cheap) is what should persist.

## Essential reading (template learnings — do not skip)

- **`docs/nonlinear-component-modeling.md`** — the ONLY two non-WDF-native parts are the **CD4049UBE
  clipper** and the **J201 JFET stage**; this doc has the datasheets/papers/SPICE + recommended
  modeling approach + the pre-DSP capture list for both (source PDFs in `docs/refs/`). Read before
  the nonlinear-stage build steps.

- **`docs/calibration-and-gain-staging.md`** — input-load (`kInputRef`) calibration, output-makeup
  calibration (level-match to captures — NOT a ~0.9 headroom pad; see §2), the DRIVE taper-floor
  bug, output-load (negligible), internal-vs-output clipping, op-amp rails, VU idle gate. This is
  where the non-obvious time-sinks are documented.
- **`docs/validation-and-capture.md`** — how to measure how close the plugin is to the real pedal
  (1/3-oct FR, continuous Farina swept-THD, sub-sample null, knob-tracking pass/fail) and how to
  CAPTURE the pedal so the measurement is trustworthy (bypass anchor, one-knob-at-a-time, sweep
  Volume, no truncation). The capture MATRIX, not the signal, is the usual limitation.
- **`analysis/`** — the reusable harness: `gen_test_signal.py` (comprehensive A/B signal) +
  `analyze.py` (load/align, FR, THD, Farina swept-THD, sub-sample null, filename parser).
- **`docs/ui-peripheral-spec.md`** — full visual spec for the reusable UI elements.
- **`src/ui/`** — drop-in `PedalLookAndFeel`, `VUMeter`, `ThreePositionSwitch`, `LEDIndicator`.
- **`src/utils/TaperUtils.h`** — taper helpers (note `audioTaperR0` for large gain pots).

## Build sequence (validate each step before the next — do not skip ahead)

1. **Schematic analysis** → fill `circuit.md`. Heed the schematic-reading gotchas there. Use the
   `schematic-checker` agent to cross-check any value/topology question against what's already
   captured, rather than re-reading the schematic image from scratch each time.
2. **CMake scaffold** — APVTS + AU/VST3 targets loading in a DAW.
3. **chowdsp_wdf smoke test** — trivial RC lowpass, confirm −3 dB point within 1% (offline/unit
   test, not a visual guess).
4. **Stage-by-stage DSP**, validated at each step:
   - Linear stages: frequency response vs expected transfer function.
   - Nonlinear stage: sine-clipping behaviour; confirm output polarity with a DC-step test.
   - Run the `dsp-validator` agent against each stage before moving to the next — it cross-checks
     component values, taper curves, and WDF topology against `circuit.md`/`dsp.md` for you.
5. **Switch topologies** — verify each position independently (precomputed scattering matrices).
   `dsp-validator` covers this too (topology + `setSMatrixData()` usage).
6. **Oversampling + ADAA** on the nonlinear stage — verify aliasing reduction. Use AccurateOmega
   (not chowdsp's default omega4). Add a separate render-time OS factor.
7. **Full-chain integration + level calibration** — anchor `kInputRef` from a real measurement;
   **calibrate output makeup to the reference captures** (may exceed 1.0; don't pad for headroom —
   calibration doc §2). Build an `OfflineRender` console exe mirroring `processBlock` for A/B.
8. **UI** — reuse the peripheral elements; design the centre pedal face per this pedal.
9. **Reference validation** — generate the comprehensive signal (`analysis/gen_test_signal.py`),
   capture the pedal per `docs/validation-and-capture.md`, and A/B with the harness: FR (1/3-oct),
   continuous swept-THD, null depth, knob-tracking pass/fail. Decompose any level deficit (§4)
   before changing constants.
10. **Final sweep** — all controls full range: no instability, clicks, or NaN/Inf. (Output > 0 dBFS
    at extreme drive+volume is faithful, not a fault — the output trim manages it.)

## Current step

> Update this at the start/end of each session so progress doesn't rely on conversation history.
> **CURRENT: Step 1 (Schematic analysis) — COMPLETE, all open items closed (2026-07-19 session 3).**
> `circuit.md` is fully verified: full chain traced IN→OUT, node-by-node + value-by-value cross-check
> against primary p.4, backup, and both BOM pages, PLUS (session 3): ✅ Baxandall + LO-MID/HI-MID

> ✅ [ENG] mid-cap table validated by nodal sim (all 6 positions within ±8.5%; per-position boost

> capture-validate) → 2× Sallen-Key LPF → LEVEL → BLEND(clean crossfade) → EQ (4-band, switchable
> mids) → MASTER[ENG] → output buffer. XLR DI + power beyond VD skipped. Ultra features are [ENG].
> **TRIPLE-CHECK PASS also done (same session):** BOM↔circuit.md 100% diff-clean; 11 load-bearing
> topology claims independently re-verified against the p.4 image (fresh-eyes agent, all CONFIRMED);
> backup schematic corroborates the tone-stack/output redraws; p.3 measured tables ↔ nodal sim agree
> ~3%/±2.5 dB; info.txt + dsp.md cross-checked. See circuit.md Validation notes ("TRIPLE-CHECK PASS").
> **NEXT: Step 2 (CMake scaffold) — follow `docs/build-plan.md`** (the full step-by-step plan for the
> rest of the build, written 2026-07-19). First actions: add `libs/` submodules (JUCE, chowdsp_wdf,
> xsimd — not yet present), instantiate CMakeLists.txt from the template, minimal
> PluginProcessor/Editor loading in a DAW. Remaining capture-blocked items (bridged-T shape, 4049
> VTC/J201 fits, mid boost ranges, kInputRef) are scheduled inside the plan — they do NOT block
> Steps 2–5.

## Project-specific carry-forwards

> Record decisions, measured constants (kInputRef, rail voltages, makeup), and open questions here

- **Target = Darkglass B7K Ultra** (schematic is the original-B7K "Black Mirror VII" clone; Ultra
  extras engineered on top). **8 pots**: MASTER[ENG], BLEND, LEVEL, DRIVE, LO, HI, LO-MID, HI-MID.
  Plus 3-way ATTACK[ENG] + 3-way GRUNT switches, and 3-position Lo-Mid/Hi-Mid freq selectors[ENG].
- **Engineered (not schematic-verified) parts** — flagged [ENG] in circuit.md: MASTER volume stage
  (post-EQ divider → IC6_B, also DI level); 3-way ATTACK (2-pos ULTRA-HI + centre Flat); switchable
  mid caps — Lo-Mid 47n/10n/2n2 (250/500/1k), Hi-Mid 15n/3n3/820pF (750/1.5k/3k). ✅ All six
  positions validated by nodal sim (±8.5% worst) AND the sim cross-checks against the p.3 measured
  tables (~3% / ±2.5 dB) — see circuit.md mid-band note. **Plus a 2nd DIST-engage
  footswitch** (real Ultra has 2 footswitches; ours only has 1 in the BOM) — model as a bool that
  overrides the BLEND crossfade to 100% clean, not a second bypass loop.
- **Web-confirmed 2026-07-19** (real Darkglass manual + reviews): Master/Attack wording and both
  mid-frequency sets match our `info.txt`/computed values exactly — high confidence. The DIST
  footswitch was new information, not previously in any doc.
- **Supply: single 9V, no charge pump.** 9V → D3 (1N5817) → +9V rail ≈ 8.6V. **VD = 4.5V**
  (R30/R31 10k/10k divider + 100µF, unbuffered). Op-amps TL072ACP/TL074ACN, clipper CD4049**UBE**.
- **Clipping = CMOS inverter (CD4049UBE) overdrive**, NOT diodes. D1/D2 (1N4148) are input rail
  clamps (~[−0.6, +9.6]V), rarely conduct. Model the 4049 transfer curve as the nonlinearity.
- **JFET stage (Q1/Q2 J201)** is an active gain stage (Q1 common-source + Q2 active load), not
  switches — needs a JFET device model or fitted gain+waveshaper. (See circuit.md / dsp.md.)
- **Non-WDF-native parts = ONLY the CD4049UBE clipper + the J201 JFET stage** (everything else is
  R/C/ideal-op-amp/diode). Modeling sources gathered 2026-07-19 → `docs/nonlinear-component-modeling.md`
  (+ 4 PDFs in `docs/refs/`: TI CD4049 datasheet, DAFx-2020 "Red Llama" CD4049-overdrive model,
  Fairchild J201 datasheet, DAFx-2024 JFET-WDF). Recommended: fit an asymmetric-tanh VTC waveshaper
  for the 4049 (DAFx params as ground-truth), and fit gain+soft-waveshaper for the J201 (part spread
  ~5:1 → must fit-to-capture, nominal SPICE won't match). **Pre-DSP capture plan is §4 of that doc**
  — do it in one matched session; it also resolves the IC2_B ~720 Hz bridged-T notch question.
- **Capture unit CONFIRMED = a real B7K Ultra, audio-only (¼" in→out, no internal probing).** Big
  win: we capture & VALIDATE all [ENG] features directly (Master, 3-way Attack, DIST footswitch,
  switchable mids incl. the 750 Hz Hi-Mid). Nonlinear models + the IC2_B notch are
  inferred from composite in→out (control-isolation + matched-pair diff). Finalized capture MATRIX
  (~29 essential takes, deviation-from-REF-OD-baseline filenames) = `docs/nonlinear-component-modeling.md`
  §4. Parser `parse_capture()` added to `analysis/analyze.py` (8 pots + 4 three-way switches + DIST,
  tested against the whole matrix). Missing DC/rail values → take nominal from datasheets, calibrate
  the clip ceiling to the bypass+drive captures.
- **Value discrepancies resolved:** C33 = 22n (primary+BOM; backup's 2200pF is a different rev).
  GRUNT C13 = 220n (primary; backup 22n). Using primary values throughout. Both re-confirmed against
  BOM + schematic in the 2026-07-19 verification pass.
- **IC2_B recovery is a UNITY BUFFER, not a +12 dB active shelf** (verified in BOTH schematics —
  pin6 tied to pin7). The 100k/33k/680pF/22n parts are a passive bridged-T on the buffer output, not
  a feedback/gain leg. Consequence: **no recovery makeup gain exists** — do not budget +12 dB into
  gain-staging. Ideal sim of the bridged-T = deep ~720 Hz notch/scoop (tolerance-sensitive, surprising)
  → capture the real unit before finalising this section. Classic "same values ≠ same topology" trap.
- **C4 (JFET Q2)** connects gate→source(output) as a bootstrap, NOT gate→GND (was mis-stated).
- **R19 (1k)** is in the BOM but not yet located in the traced path — minor, non-critical, find it later.
- **Reusable crop tool** for the dense p.4 schematic: `schematics/crop.py` (see circuit.md crop index).
- **R19 (1k) RESOLVED (2026-07-19):** it's the CD4049's +9V supply dropper (only IC with one) —
  clipper clip-ceiling is BELOW the 8.6V op-amp rail and sags with signal. Calibrate the ceiling to
  captures, don't hardcode 8.6V. BOM fully reconciles (R1–R54 all located).
- **Tone stack fully node-verified (2026-07-19):** Baxandall (both wipers sum into IC5_C virtual gnd
  via R35/R36; C25/C26 run lug→wiper; R37 fb is 1 MΩ, schematic label "1m") and both mid stages
  (R41/R44 in→(−), R40/R45 (−)→out flat-unity legs; wiper→series-cap→(−)). Node graphs in circuit.md.
  Nodal sim validates all six [ENG] mid-cap positions (±8.5% worst) — per-position boost range varies
  (±14.5–28 dB), confirm against captures. GRUNT corners need the 4049's finite gain (~20–30) — model
  the clipper input as a coupled network, not ideal-virtual-ground.
- **C36 = 2u2 is schematic-verified** (EQ out coupling). Stock board has NO bias R on IC6_B(+) after
  C36; the [ENG] Master pot's VD leg supplies the DC path — cleaner than stock, no extra part.
- **UI assets ready in `ui/`** (knobs, footswitch, LEDs, switches, textures, VU trim — PNG with
  alpha, noon-position, rotation-safe) with prep guidelines in `ui/ui-replacements.md` (2x-resolution
  policy, crop-don't-stretch, resize-to-minimise). Use these for the Step 8 pedal face instead of
  procedural drawing where they fit; keep `src/ui/` LookAndFeel for the peripheral chrome.
- **Full build plan: `docs/build-plan.md`** (2026-07-19) — step-by-step from submodules to release,
  with per-step validation gates and the capture-session checklist folded in.
